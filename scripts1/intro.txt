This folder contains some new scripts which I have been creating on my own in order to learn Python. For me, Python is a fun
language to learn, and suited for me as it is an important tool in my line of work. For an introduction, I am an aspiring Penetration Tester working in a decent IT corporation. For occupying my free time, I burden myself with tasks such as sleeping, reading, and when the fit is upon me, to pick up something new, which is actually engaging and constructive. Apart from being bored to death most of the times, I do have an ardent devotion to computer gaming. 

To be honest, filling up the space here seems to be an arduous task, especially for a lazy bum as myself. So, with high hopes of making a name for myself someday (* in a good way, of course *). fare thee well!!!
